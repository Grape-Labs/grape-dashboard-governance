# grape-dashboard-governance-component
This is an example of a component that can be quickly integrated to the Grape Dashboard

This has been implemented for the Governance Program as an example:

- Currently only holdings deposited will show for Grape
- Future enhancements should include
-   Displaying all positions that the wallet can participate in
-   Viewing all active proposals in any given realm
-   Ability to cast votes on a proposal
-   Ability to withdraw holdings
